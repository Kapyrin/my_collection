# Homework for creating own java collection
### The [OwnArrayListCollection](/src/main/java/kapyrin/collection/OwnArrayListCollection.java) and the [OwnLinkedListCollection](/src/main/java/kapyrin/collection/OwnLinkedListCollection.java)  are custom collection classes in Java.
### - They include functionality similar to standard Java collections such as `ArrayList` and  `LinkedList` with methods for adding, removing, setting, bubble sorting and others...
### - These collections have been tested using the following test classes:
  - [OwnArrayListCollectionTest](src/test/java/kapyrin/collection/OwnArrayListCollectionTest.java)
  - [OwnLinkedListCollectionTest](src/test/java/kapyrin/collection/OwnLinkedListCollectionTest.java)
